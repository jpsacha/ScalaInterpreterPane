## statement

ScalaInterpreterPane is a Swing component for editing code in the Scala programming language and executing it in an
interpreter. The editor component is based on [SyntaxPane](https://github.com/Sciss/SyntaxPane).
ScalaInterpreterPane is (C)opyright 2010&ndash;2021 by Hanns Holger Rutz. All rights reserved. It is released under

## requirements

This project builds with sbt against Scala 2.13, 2.12, Dotty. The last version to support Scala 2.11 was 1.10.1.

To use it in your own project, add the following to `build.sbt`:

    libraryDependencies += "de.sciss" %% "scalainterpreterpane" % v

The current version `v` is `"1.11.1"`

There is also the `assembly` target which creates a standalone jar in `targets`.

## overview

There are two independent components, `CodePane` and `Interpreter`. The former encapsulates the Swing widget 
for editing source code with syntax highlighting. The latter encapsulates the Scala REPL.

All have their dedicated configurations, based on a division between (mutable) `ConfigBuilder` and
(immutable) `Config`. A builder is implicitly converted to a `Config` when necessary.

For example, to create a plain code view:

```scala

    import de.sciss.scalainterpreter._

    val codeCfg     = CodePane.Config()         // creates a new configuration _builder_
    codeCfg.style   = Style.Light               // use a light color scheme
    codeCfg.text    = """List(1, 2, 3)"""       // initial text to show in the widget
    codeCfg.font    = List("Helvetica" -> 16)   // list of preferred fonts
    // add a custom key action
    codeCfg.keyMap += javax.swing.KeyStroke.getKeyStroke("control U") -> { () =>
      println("Action!")
    }

    val codePane    = CodePane(codeCfg)         // create the pane
    val f           = new javax.swing.JFrame("REPL Test")
    // the actual javax.swing.JComponent is found at codePane.component.
    f.getContentPane.add(codePane.component, "Center")
    f.pack()
    f.setVisible(true)
```

To create an interpreter:

```scala

    import de.sciss.scalainterpreter._
    val intpCfg = Interpreter.Config()
    intpCfg.imports :+= "javax.swing._"         // add default imports
    intpCfg.bindings :+= "pi" -> math.Pi        // add predefined bindings

    val intp = Interpreter(intpCfg)             // create the interpreter
    // invoke the interpreter
    val res = intp.interpret("""Seq.tabulate(10)(i => math.sin(pi * i/10))""")
```

The result of `interpret` is either of `Interpreter.Result`, e.g. `Interpreter.Success` carrying the name and value of the result.

`CodePane` and `Interpreter` can be manually patched together using an entry in the code pane's `keyMap` setting which queries the currently selected text using `codePane.getSelectedText` and feeding that into the `interpret` method. But it is more convenient to use `InterpreterPane` instead, which already combines the two. Furthermore, there is a utility widget `LogPane` which can be used to direct the console output to. Using `SplitPane`, a fully self-contained system can be set up, containing a code pane in the top, a status bar in the middle, and a console log in the bottom:

```scala

    import de.sciss.scalainterpreter._
    val split = SplitPane()
    val f     = new javax.swing.JFrame("REPL Test")
    f.getContentPane.add(split.component, "Center")
    f.pack()
    f.setVisible(true)
```

If you use scala-swing, the components can be wrapped using `swing.Component.wrap(_)`.

## limitations

- auto-completion is based on the standard Scala REPL's auto completion, thus will only see values which have been
  executed in the interpreter before
- Dotty support is very basic; auto-completion for argument lists is not yet implemented
- the result value of an evaluation is currently not directly available

## related

For a standalone desktop application, [ScalaCollider-Swing](https://github.com/Sciss/ScalaColliderSwing) is very 
useful. It has a multi-document-adapter and  window docking and comes with cross-platform and Debian-based binary 
installers.

There are various projects which provide similar functionality or part of the functionality:

- https://github.com/Bridgewater/scala-notebook - console in a browser interface
- https://github.com/jedesah/scala-codesheet-api - code sheet is a slightly different concept with respect to execution
- https://github.com/MasseGuillaume/ScalaKata2 - console in a browser interface
- https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea - an alternative to JSyntaxPane
- http://code.google.com/p/scalide/ - Swing based REPL, stopped in 2009
- https://github.com/kjellwinblad/ScalaEdit - Swing based editor based on RSyntaxTextArea, stopped in 2011
- https://github.com/Centaur/scalaconsole - Swing based console, stopped in 2011
